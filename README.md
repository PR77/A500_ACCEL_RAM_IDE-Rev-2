# Overview
The main purpose of this design is to improve on of the Rev 1. As the Rev 1 design was essentially a proof of concept, Rev 2 will support a Larger CPLD, SPI Headers, Expansion Header, Configuration Jumpers and an IDE header which is correctly pinned. However, most importantly support the MC68SEC000.
